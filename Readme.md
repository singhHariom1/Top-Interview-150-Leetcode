## 📌 Problem-Solving Approach

1️⃣ Understand the problem and constraints clearly.  
2️⃣ Identify the pattern (two-pointer, greedy, DP, etc.).  
3️⃣ Choose the right data structure.  
4️⃣ Code the brute-force, then optimize.  
5️⃣ Analyze time and space complexity.  
6️⃣ Write clean code with meaningful comments.  
7️⃣ Commit the solution with a descriptive message.
